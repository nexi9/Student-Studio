            <p>To tackle the issue of having to refer to various sites to meet their daily academical needs, we have tried to develop a website for easier access to all the tools required for the above purpose. It is a website developed for the students,
                by students.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>We have a notes page to help keep track of important stuff, a to-do list to mark all upcoming events, a fully-functioning calculator for simple calculations on the go, a calender to be reminded of important dates and a game to refresh the
                mind.
            </p>
